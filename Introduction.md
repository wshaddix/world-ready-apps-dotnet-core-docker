# Introducing the Tracked Consent Application
In order to fully appreciate all of the decisions, development, costs and challenges that go into building a world-ready application, we are going to create a complete and fully working application throughout this book. The application that we will build is a consent tracking application. It's purpose is to allow any business to keep track of how their customers want to be contacted. In addition, it allows any customer to have full control of their contact preferences with all of the companies that they do business with from a single location.

The primary example that we'll use to guide our efforts are based on two main actors, a Customer and a Business. A Business is any company that has Customers and wants to be able to communicate with those Customers in some way. A Customer is anyone who does buys goods or services from a Business and gives consent for that Business to contact the Customer.

It will get more complicated than that, but in general, this is the system that we will build. By the end of this book you will have a fully working, production ready application that has both a web and native mobile interface with an api that can scale infinitely large as usage demands.
